# Traveling Salesperson
#### Benjamin E. Kaplan

This Python package implements the nearest-neighbor algorithm with 2-opt swapping for solving the traveling salesperson 
problem (TSP).

## Installation

Checkout this git repository and install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

## Running

You can run the algorithm on any input file as long as it is in `.csv` format and has the same heading as in the example 
files found in `data/*`.  (The two examples in that directory have been taken from 
[this site](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html).)
